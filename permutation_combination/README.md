#### Longest Valid Parentheses

> Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.
For "(()", the longest valid parentheses substring is "()", which has length = 2.
Another example is ")()())", where the longest valid parentheses substring is "()()", which has length = 4.

### Permutations

> Given a collection of distinct numbers, return all possible permutations.
  For example,
  [1,2,3] have the following permutations:

    [
      [1,2,3],
      [1,3,2],
      [2,1,3],
      [2,3,1],
      [3,1,2],
      [3,2,1]
    ]

### Permutations II

> Given a collection of numbers that might contain duplicates, return all possible unique permutations.
  For example,
  [1,1,2] have the following unique permutations:

    [
      [1,1,2],
      [1,2,1],
      [2,1,1]
    ]
